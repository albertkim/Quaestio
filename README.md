# Quaestio

A Node.js + Sails.js framework appication.

This application will facillitate the accumulation of knowledge throughout semesters to make course content learning more efficient.

A big problem we see in university courses today is that nothing carries over from students in one term to another. Of course, part
of this would be the professors who don't want course materials leaking outside, but this leads to efficiency problems. If a student
discovers a great resource to learn a particular topic in the course, there is no way for that knowledge to be relayed to the next
term. It's difficult to propagate helpful information within the courses themselves most of the time, as usually the professor fully
controls the information students see.

Users will be able to make forum posts alongside posting resources to discuss anything related to the course. Highest-voted topics
will be available for viewing in later terms (not all will be made available, since most posts do not provide universal value to
students in the course).

The ideal use case for our platform would be for students to write quick helpful notes or post external resources (ex. YouTube 
videos, tutorials) for each unit of a course. Over time, this knowledge will accumulate, and subsequent students will have access to
the resources students from previous years have found the most useful for specific topics.

This is very much subject to change based on reception and actual use cases.
